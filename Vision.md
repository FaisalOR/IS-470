| **(a) Vision** |
 |   ---------------- |
 
 My vision is have my own PC built with high quality components and to make sure that my system is capable of satisfying all my personal preferences. By researching each indisual component's capabilties and limitations, I can tayylor my purchases to my exact needs right now and in the future because building a PC from scratch *keeps the door open for upgrades as technology changes.*
 
 ## As I mentioned in the preveious assignment->

### Problem:	
Many people prefer the quickest way to get a computer by buying a prefab PC and have it up and running. However, some manufactures try to save money by putting cheap parts or/and lower quality parts such as the power supply or hard drive which can quickly cause a PC to crash.

### Goal/Success: 	
Building my own PC will actually save me money in the long run because I will likely not to repair or replace components as often as with a pre-built. Additionally, if a component fails inside the PC I built, it would be much easier to identify because I am already familiar with each part. 

By creating an excel sheet that include all components and their prices as well as putting all the parts in PC part picker (system Builder) to organize database that allows me to select PC parts based on a variety of vendors and then checks for compatibility and any existing warnings. 


### Tools:	
- Excel spreadsheet templates.

- PC part Picker which helps me to keep track on prices and check on the dimensions.
