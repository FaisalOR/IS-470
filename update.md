# A summary:
-----------
My personal project IT is to build my own PC, so I had created four product backlogs:
- PB001 - What components to buy.
- PB002 - Checking on the dimension of each part to make sure they all fit perfectly especially the *case* since it contains all components.
- PB003 - Listing prices of components to keep track on high quality parts that I want to purchase for their normal price so I do not go over my budget or pay extra for each component. 
- PB004 - Having all components delivered to my address by the end of **March**.
PB001 and PB002 are already in the **DONE** column, and PB003 and PB004 are still in **IN PROGRESS** column. I have already listed all components that I am willing to buy in the system builder as well as I have checked the dimensions of each component and make sure that they all fit together perfectly. However, I am still waiting for the prices of GPUs to go back to their normal prices. The GPU that I am willing to buy is GeForce RTX 2060 SUPER. 

### And here is my screen shot of PB001 and PB002 product backlogs that are that are successfully delivered by the end of sprint 2:

# Conduct a personal project retrospective:
------------------------------------------
### What went well?

- Deciding what components to buy was pretty much easy
- For product backlog 002, my goal was to find a perfect size *CASE* that can contain all my components with no warnings. Also, the case is one of the main components that I need to choose carefully so if I want to upgrade any component within my PC, I can easily attach this new components with other components with no dimensions errors. 

### What did not go so well?

- Finding a GPU which stands for **graphics processing unit** was hard since most of the GPUs are out of stock and/or their prices are being increased. 

### What have I learned?

I have learned a lot since I started my personal IT project
- I have learned how to use GitHub and Git
- I have learned how to use Kanban template 
- I have learned how manage my tasks within a project by dividing a whole project into sprints and assigned time to each sprint and make sure to finish each sprint on time to deliver the whole project.
